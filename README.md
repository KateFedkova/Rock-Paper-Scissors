## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I have used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has tested my understanding of conditional statements, determining the winner: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. I have tried to keep my code concise and intuitive.
